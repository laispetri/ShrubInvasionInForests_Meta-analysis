# ShrubInvasionInForests_Meta-analysis
---

The files in DRYAD allow readers to run models to reproduce results and figures of the paper "Assessing the mechanisms and impacts of shrub invasion in forests: a meta-analysis", published in Journal of Applied Ecology (https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.14496). 

The code for to reproduce results and figures can be found at https://github.com/laispetri/ShrubInvasionInForests_Meta-analysis.


## Description of the data and file structure

The code was build in RMarkdown. All packages needed are listed in the beginning of code, along with extra information on how to organize folder within the working directory. 

Here is the description of the CSV files:

Details on the "Data.csv" file variables above can be found in the supplements of the paper.

- "InvEstimateRESULTS.csv": ObsIDOriginal = unique identifier for an observation (integer), ESInvmean = estimated mean effect size of invasive species performance (double), ESInvSD = estimated standard deviation of invasive species performance (double).

- "NatBioticEstimateRESULTS.csv": ObsIDOriginal = unique identifier for an observation (integer), ESNatmean = estimated mean effect size of native community performance (double), ESNatSD = estimated standard deviation of native community performance (double).

- "NatAbioticEstimateRESULTS.csv"": ObsIDOriginal = unique identifier for an observation (integer), ESNatmean = estimated mean effect size of abiotic features of the native community (double), ESNatSD = estimated standard deviation of abiotic features of the native community (double).

Cells with missing data are filled with NAs.
